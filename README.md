# Dog-Breed-Classifier
• A pre-trained image classifier to classify dog breeds. Udacity Nanodegree project-1.
• The main objective is to apply python skills on the implementation of classification of Dog Breeds.
• The Classifier function `classifier.py` is provided initially and it allows to use CNN pre-trained models architectures : VGG / AlexNet /      ResNet which are used to classify the images.
• The classified results of each architecture are compared.
• Six related python scripts are implemented to be used in `check_images.py`.
• Classification take place on the provided `pet_images` and custom `uploaded_images` by running the script `check_images.py`.
``` 
python check_images.py --dir [<image-folder-name/] --arch [architecture-type] --dogfile dognames.txt 
```
